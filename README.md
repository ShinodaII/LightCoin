## LightCoin

This is a fictitious crypto-currency made for my minor project to demonstrate the working of a blockchain system where users can mine lightcoins and engage in transactions.
This is very much a prototype and has no real world purpose apart from mild amusement. 

The cryptocurrency is named after one of my favorite anime characters Light Yagami and the logo is directly stolen from the anime Death Note. Pls don't sue.
